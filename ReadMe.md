## RNN_GUI
This is a Recurrent Neural network (RNN) i made with tensor flow using:
https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation
I added a GUI system to it
There is a pre-trained model, I trained it for 100 epochs which took about 3 hours.
To train your own model, edit the 'training data.txt' with the training data of your
choosing and then train it in the 'Train.py' file. 
It is trained on Breaking Bad, The Bee Movie, Shakespeare, and some discord conversations.
